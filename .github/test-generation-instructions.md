# Test Generation Instructions

- **File Structure:** Tests should be saved in the appropriate project directory under the `tests` folder, adding "Tests" to the project name and file name. For instance, if the code file is located at `/{ProjectName}/{FilePath}/{FileName}.cs`, then the test file should be saved at `/Codeacula.Tests/{ProjectName}/{FilePath}/{FileName}Tests.cs`
